# [The Playground]

- The Playground is the quickest and easiest way to make your own scene.
  - Creating a 3D scene is easy, simply add a camera, lights and 3D shapes (meshes) and you are away.
  - Everything else you need is taken care of within the Playground.
  - Experimenting and changing any code in the playground and clicking on the Run button will not affect any original code in the playground you currently using. Original code can be restored by refreshing the browser.

You can write the code in JavaScript or Typescript. The playground software compiles the code to JavaScript, in the background, before rendering.

## The Playground consists of four areas

- a coding editor on the left
- a rendering area of the right
- a menu bar at the top
- a links bar at the bottom

## Menu

- Title and Version
- Language: Typescript/JavaScript switch.
- Run: Commands the playground to try to render your scene.
- Save: Causes your scene to be permanently stored in the playground's database and it will issue a unique URL for each save.
- Download: Allows you to download a zip file named sample.zip. Once downloaded and unzipped, you will see a file named index.html which contains everything necessary to run the code in your browser, including links to external babylon.js and other files.
- New: Places a basic createScene() function into the editor along with code to initialise the scene variable and provide a camera.
- Clear: Empties all the code out of the playground editor.
- Settings: The Settings button has a sub menu with extra options
- Version: Allows and shows your choice of the BABYLON.js framework, either the current stable one or the latest preview version.
- Examples: A drop down menu giving examples of playgrounds with a search filter.
