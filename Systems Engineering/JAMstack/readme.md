# [JAMstack]

A modern architecture â€”
Create fast and secure sites and dynamic apps with JavaScript, APIs, and prerendered Markup, served without web servers.

Any project that relies on a tight coupling between client and server is not built with the JAMstack.

1. Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by JavaScript, running entirely on the client.
2. All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript.
3. Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time, usually using a site generator for content sites, or a build tool for web apps.
