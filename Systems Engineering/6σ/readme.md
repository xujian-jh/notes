# [6σ]

## `6σ` in Statistics Category

`Mean` is the arithmetic average of a process data set.

`Central tendency` is the tendency of data to be around this mean.

`Standard Deviation` (also known as `Sigma` or `σ`) determines the spread around this mean/central tendency.

- Lower Specification Limit (LSL)
- Upper Specification Limit (USL)

- The more number of standard deviations between process average and acceptable process limits fits, the less likely that the process performs beyond the acceptable process limits, and it causes a defect.
  - This is the reason why a 6σ (Six Sigma) process performs better than 1σ, 2σ, 3σ, 4σ, 5σ processes.
  - the practitioners gained the belief that a 6σ process is good enough to be reliable in almost all major situations except some systems whose defects can cause unrepairable consequences.

### History: Quality Movement

- [PDCA] from the 1950s
  - PDCA (plan–do–check–act) is an iterative four-step management method used in business for the control and continuous improvement of processes and products.
  - Another version of this PDCA cycle is OPDCA.
    - The added "O" stands for observation or as some versions say: "Observe the current condition."
    - This emphasis on observation and current condition has currency with the literature on lean manufacturing and the Toyota Production System.
  - It is also known as the Deming cycle, the Shewhart cycle, the control cycle.
  - PDCA was made popular by W. Edwards Deming.
    - Later in Deming's career, he modified PDCA to "Plan, Do, Study, Act" (PDSA) because he felt that "check" emphasized inspection over analysis.
- TQC (Total Quality Control) from the 1960s
  - TQC was made popular by Armand Vallin Feigenbaum.
- [TQM] from the 1980s
