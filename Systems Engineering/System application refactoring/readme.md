# System application refactoring

## Principles

- System applications which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.
  - The free software takes precedence over the open source software.
  - The B/S architecture takes precedence over the C/S architecture.
  - The mobile apps take precedence over the desktop apps.
