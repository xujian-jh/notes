# [Cockpit]

Cockpit, the easy-to-use, integrated, glanceable, and open web-based interface for your servers.

Switching over to Cockpit was a change that was made by Red Hat, I’m sure there was a good reason for it.

In the meantime, Cockpit is a constantly evolving project – new features are added all the time.
