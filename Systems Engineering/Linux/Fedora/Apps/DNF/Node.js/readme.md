# [Node.js]

- Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.
  - Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
- npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.
  - The npm registry contains over 20,000 libraries and programs available under free and open source licenses, many of which are also now available in Fedora.
