# [MES](Manufacturing Execution System)

- An MES is an information system that connects, monitors and controls complex manufacturing systems and data flows on the factory floor.
- The main goal of an MES is to ensure effective execution of the manufacturing operations and improve production output.
- An MES helps achieve that goal by tracking and gathering accurate, real-time data about the complete production lifecycle, beginning with order release until the product delivery stage for finished goods.
  - The MES collects data about product genealogy, performance, traceability, material management and work in progress (WIP) and other plant activities as they occur.
  - MES maintains an "as-built" or device history record (DHR) for each product unit and batch by collecting data, processes and outcomes of the manufacturing process.
- What makes the MES system important is that it serves as a functional layer between the ERP and the process control systems on the factory floor, giving manufacturers real-time workflow visibility, flexibility and insight into how best to improve enterprise-wide manufacturing operations.
- An MES is often integrated with ERP, supply chain management, product lifecycle management and other key IT systems.
