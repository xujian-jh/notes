# [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, first published in 1989, is a business and self-help book written by Stephen Covey.

## The P/PC Balance



## The concept of paradigm shift

Covey introduces the concept of paradigm shift and helps the reader understand that different perspectives exist, i.e. that two people can see the same thing and yet differ with each other.

## The Maturity Continuum

Covey also introduces the Maturity Continuum. These are three successive stages of increasing maturity: dependence, independence, and interdependence.

- Dependence means you need others to get what you need. All of us began life as an infant, depending on others for nurturing and sustenance. I may be intellectually dependent on other people's thinking; I may be emotionally dependent on other people's affirmation and validation of me. Dependence is the attitude of "you": you take care of me... or you don't come through and I blame you for the result.
- Independence means you are pretty much free from the external influence and support of others. ... Independence is the attitude of "I". ... It is the avowed goal of many individuals, and also many social movements, to enthrone independence as the highest level of achievement, but it is not the ultimate goal in effective living. There is a far more mature and more advanced level.
- The third and highest level in the Maturity Continuum is interdependence. ... We live in an interdependent reality. Interdependence is essential for good leaders; good team players; a successful marriage or family life; in organizations. Interdependence is the attitude of "we": we can co-operate; we can be a team; we can combine our talents.

## The first three habits surround moving from dependence to independence (i.e., self-mastery)

### 1. Be proactive

- Take responsibility for your reaction to your experiences, take the initiative to respond positively and improve the situation.
- Recognize your Circle of Influence and Circle of Concern.
- Focus your responses and initiates on the center of your influence and constantly work to expand it.
- Don't sit and wait in a reactive mode, waiting for problems to happen (Circle of Concern) before taking action.

### 2. Begin with the end in mind

- Envision what you want in the future so you can work and plan towards it.
- Understand how people make decisions in their life.
- To be effective you need to act based on principles and constantly review your mission statement. Are you - right now - who you want to be? What do I have to say about myself? How do you want to be remembered?
- If habit 1 advises changing your life to act and be proactive, habit 2 advises that you are the programmer!
- Grow and stay humble.

### 3. Put first things first
