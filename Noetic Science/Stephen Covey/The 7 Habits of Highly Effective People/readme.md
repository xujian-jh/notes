# [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, first published in 1989, is a business and self-help book written by Stephen Covey.

## The P/PC Balance

You can be efficient with things but not with people. With people you must be effective. True effectiveness is when you can attain a balance between P and Pc (between Production and Production Capability).

Do you remember Aesop’s fable of the goose and the golden egg?

One morning a farmer finds a glittering, golden-colored egg sitting beneath his goose. At first he thinks it is a prank, but he decides to have the egg appraised just in case.  
To the farmer’s amazement, the egg is pure gold!
And each morning his prize goose continues laying the valuable eggs.  
The farmer becomes extremely wealthy. But he also becomes greedy and impatient.  
One day in his frustration the farmer kills the goose, hoping to get all of the golden eggs at once from inside the goose.  
As we all know, the farmer finds nothing. And now, he has neither a goose nor any more golden eggs.

Aesops fable shows us that true effectiveness is a function of two things: What is produced (golden eggs) and the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose).

The P/PC balance is all about balancing the two extremes:

- Extreme #1: Focusing only on golden eggs or producing short-term results. In the long-run, you lose your ability to produce results at all because you never nurture your production capacity.
- Extreme #2: Focusing only on the goose or production capacity. Without short-term results, you will not survive (literally or figuratively) to see the long-term payoff.

The goal is to balance these two extremes. Because being only in one of the two extremes is disastorous. Effectiveness lies in the balance between P and PC. It balances short term with long term.

## Paradigm and paradigm shift

Covey introduces the concept of paradigm shift and helps the reader understand that different perspectives exist, i.e. that two people can see the same thing and yet differ with each other.

Paradigms are the mental maps that we use to describe the world around us. They are the lens that each of us uses to understand everyone and everything. The key of a paradigm isn't as much in the true nature of a thing as much as our perception of the thing. They also deal with our views and our mental perspective due to to the actions done around us.

A pattern shift is the change in one's perspective concerning the way we perceive things. They are two different things: changing the way we see things around us and changing the things around us. Covey describes how once he was frustrated in the subway to see the very bad behavior of a man's children, but when he found out that they were coming from the hospital where the mother had just died an hour before, his perspective changed completely.

The key to maintaining a good paradigm(s) is to keep an open mind, be optimistic and realize that however much we see. There is always more to the picture than just the painting, depending on the audience.

Kuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962).  
Kuhn used the duck-rabbit optical illusion, made famous by Wittgenstein, to demonstrate the way in which a paradigm shift could cause one to see the same information in an entirely different way.

## The Character/Personality Ethic

- The Character Ethic: aligning one's values with so-called universal and timeless principles.
  - Principles as external natural laws, while values remain internal and subjective.
  - Our values govern our behavior, while principles ultimately determine the consequences.
- The Personality Ethic
  - Personality refers to the combination of qualities, attitude and behaviour, that makes a person distinct from others.Character refers to a set of moral and mental qualities and beliefs, that makes a person different from others.
  - While personality is easier to spot, it’s largely static and slow to evolve. Character, on the other hand, takes longer to discern but is easier to change. That’s because character is shaped by beliefs, and with enough effort and motivation, changing one’s perspective and view of the world can lead to a shift in one’s character.

## The Abundance/Scarcity Mindset

- The Abundance mindset: a concept in which a person believes there are enough resources and successes to share with others.
  - Individuals having an abundance mentality reject the notion of zero-sum games and are able to celebrate the success of others, rather than feel threatened by them.
  - The author contends that the abundance mentality arises from having a high self-worth and security, and leads to the sharing of profits, recognition and responsibility. Similarly, organizations may also apply an abundance mentality when doing business.
- The Scarcity Mindset (i.e., destructive and unnecessary competition), which is founded on the idea that if someone else wins or is successful in a situation, it means you lose, because you are not considering the possibility of all parties "winning" in some way or another in a given situation (see zero-sum game).

## The Maturity Continuum

Covey also introduces the Maturity Continuum. These are three successive stages of increasing maturity: dependence, independence, and interdependence.

- Dependence means you need others to get what you need. All of us began life as an infant, depending on others for nurturing and sustenance. I may be intellectually dependent on other people's thinking; I may be emotionally dependent on other people's affirmation and validation of me. Dependence is the attitude of "you": you take care of me... or you don't come through and I blame you for the result.
- Independence means you are pretty much free from the external influence and support of others. ... Independence is the attitude of "I". ... It is the avowed goal of many individuals, and also many social movements, to enthrone independence as the highest level of achievement, but it is not the ultimate goal in effective living. There is a far more mature and more advanced level.
- The third and highest level in the Maturity Continuum is interdependence. ... We live in an interdependent reality. Interdependence is essential for good leaders; good team players; a successful marriage or family life; in organizations. Interdependence is the attitude of "we": we can co-operate; we can be a team; we can combine our talents.

## Independence

The first three habits surround moving from dependence to independence (i.e., self-mastery)

### 1. Be proactive

- Take responsibility for your reaction to your experiences, take the initiative to respond positively and improve the situation.
- Recognize your Circle of Influence and Circle of Concern.
- Focus your responses and initiates on the center of your influence and constantly work to expand it.
- Don't sit and wait in a reactive mode, waiting for problems to happen (Circle of Concern) before taking action.

### 2. Begin with the end in mind

- Envision what you want in the future so you can work and plan towards it.
- Understand how people make decisions in their life.
- To be effective you need to act based on principles and constantly review your mission statement. Are you - right now - who you want to be? What do I have to say about myself? How do you want to be remembered?

If habit 1 advises changing your life to act and be proactive, habit 2 advises that you are the programmer! Grow and stay humble.

### 3. Put first things first

- Quadrant I. Urgent and important (Do) : important deadlines and crises
- Quadrant II. Not urgent but important (Plan) : long-term development
- Quadrant III. Urgent but not important (Delegate) : distractions with deadlines
- Quadrant IV. Not urgent and not important (Eliminate): frivolous distractions

If habit 2 advises that you are the programmer, habit 3 advises: write the program, become a leader! Keep personal integrity: what you say vs what you do.

## Interdependence

The next three habits are intended to help achieve interdependence.

### 4. Think win-win

Value and respect people by understanding a "win" for all is ultimately a better long-term resolution than if only one person in the situation had gotten their way. Think Win-Win isn't about being nice, nor is it a quick-fix technique. It is a character-based code for human interaction and collaboration.

### 5. Seek first to understand, then to be understood

Use empathetic listening to genuinely understand a person, which compels them to reciprocate the listening and take an open mind to be influenced by you. This creates an atmosphere of caring, and positive problem-solving.

The order is important: ethos, pathos, logos -- your character, and your relationships, and then the logic of your presentation.

### 6. Synergize

Combine the strengths of people through positive teamwork, so as to achieve goals that no one could have done alone.

## Continual improvement

The final habit is that of continuous improvement in both the personal and interpersonal spheres of influence.

### 7. Sharpen the Saw; Growth

Covey explains the "Upward Spiral" model.

- Through our conscience, along with meaningful and consistent progress, the spiral will result in growth, change, and constant improvement.
- In essence, one is always attempting to integrate and master the principles outlined in The 7 Habits at progressively higher levels at each iteration. Subsequent development on any habit will render a different experience and you will learn the principles with a deeper understanding.
