## [The Righteous Mind] focused on the [moral foundations] of politics, and on ways to transcend the “culture wars” by using recent discoveries in moral psychology to foster more [civil forms of politics]

Foundation|Meaning|Opposite
-|-|-
Care|Cherishing and protecting others|Harm
Fairness or proportionality|Rendering justice according to shared rules|Cheating
Loyalty or ingroup|Standing with your group, family, nation|Betrayal
Authority or respect|Submitting to tradition and legitimate authority|Subversion
Sanctity or purity|Abhorrence for disgusting things, foods, actions|Degradation
Liberty|Freedom from coercion by a dominating power or person|Oppression

Once you understand these foundations you can start to see the tie that binds the whole human race together. You see both the Liberal and Conservative responses. The same moral foundation manifesting differently. Not inherently wrong, just different.
