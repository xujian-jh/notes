# C. G. Jung

- It is an extension of the individual. To study it is to deepen the self.
- All new discoveries have at one stage been called dangerous, and all new philosophies have been deemed heresies.
  - It is as though we would once more consign radium to its dust-heaps, lest some day the new radiancy should over-power mankind.
- Indeed this particular thing has proved at once most dangerous and most precious.
- Man must learn to use his treasure, and in using it to submit to its own laws, which can only become known when it is handled and investigated.

## [Collected Papers on Analytical Psychology]

- In the papers appearing for the first time in this edition (Chapters XIV. and XV.), Dr. Jung develops his ideas of introversion and extroversion, a contribution of the first importance to psychology.
  - He agrees with Freud in regarding the neuroses to be the result of repression, but differs in his view as to the origin of repression.
  - He finds this to lie not in sexuality per se(Chapters VI.), but rather in man's natural tendency to adapt to the demands of life one-sidedly, according to his type of mentality.
    - The born extrovert adapts by means of feeling, thought being under repression and relatively infantile.
    - The introvert's natural adaptation is by means of thought; feeling being more or less repressed remains undeveloped.
    - In either type the neglected co-function is behind the adapted function.
    - This inequality operating in the unconscious, brings about a conflict, which in certain subjects amounts to a neurosis, and in others produces a limitation of individual development.
  - This view shifts the interpretation of repression on to a much more comprehensive basis than that of sexuality, although there can scarcely be a repression that does not include this instinct on account of its deep and far-reaching importance in man.
