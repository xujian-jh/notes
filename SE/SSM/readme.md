# SSM (Soft Systems Methodology)

>[软系统方法论]

- The Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) from Peter Checkland is a qualitative technique that can be used for applying Systems Thinking to non-systemic situations.
-  It is a way of dealing with problem situations in which there is a high social, political and human activity component.
- This distinquishes SSM from other methodoloqies which deal with HARD problems that are often more technology-oriented.

## Steps in SSM

1. Investigate

- Non-systemic situations.

2. Rich Pictures

- Express the unstructured problems.
  - Data flow diagrams
  - class models

3. Root Definition

- Customer
  - Anyone who can benefit from the system.
- Actor
  - The actors transform inputs into outputs and they perform the activities defined in the system.
- Transformation Process
  - This is shown as the conversion of inputs to outouts.
- Weltanschauung
  - This world view makes the transformation process meaningful in context.
- Owner
  - Every system has some proprietor who has the power to start up and shut down the system (power of veto).
- Environmental Constraints
  - These are external elements that must be considered.
  - These constraints include organizational policies as well as legal and ethical matters.

4. Conceptual models.

- Formal system concept.
- Other system thinking.

5. Comparison of 4 with 2.

6. Feasible, desirable changes.

7. Action to improve the problem situation.

## Limitations of SSM

- SSM requires from participants to adapt to the overall approach.
- Be careful not to narrow the scope of the investigation too early.
- It is difficult to assemble the richest picture, without imposing a particular structure and solution on problem situation.
- People have difficulties to interpret the world in the loose way. They often show an over-urgent desire for action
