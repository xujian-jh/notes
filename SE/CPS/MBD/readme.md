# [MBE] develop into [MBSE]

With advancements in design technology, imagination has started coming closer to reality.
- [MBE] is an integrated and collaborative environment, founded on 3D product definition (Model Based Definition, MBD) shared across the enterprise, enabling rapid, seamless, and affordable deployment of products from concept to disposal.
- [MBSE] the Systems Engineering paradigm that emphasizes the application of rigorous architecture modeling principles and best practices to Systems Engineering activities throughout the [SDLC].

#### [MBE] (Model-Based Enterprise)

#### [MBSE] (Model-Based System Engineering)

Since [SysML] is the de facto architecture modeling language standard for most serious [MBSE] applications, it also explains the synergy between [MBSE] and [SysML].

#### [SysML] (Systems Modeling Language)

#### [SDLC] (System Development Life Cycle)

# Core concepts is MBD

#### MBD (Model-Based Definition)

According to the logical dimension
- 3D models
  - the single authoritative source of product definition
- TDP (Technical Data Packages)
  - PMI (Product Manufacturing Information) completeness

According to the time dimension
- MBe (Model-Based engineering)
- MBM (Model-Based Manufacture)
  - MBI (Model-Based Instruction) emphasizes communication between virtual and reality.
  - MES (Manufacturing Execution System) emphasizes on realistic execution
- MBS (Model-Based Sustainability)
  - Product data is created once and reused by all users.
