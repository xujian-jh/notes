## ON THE ART OF KAHLIL GIBRAN

In the near East there are over a hundred million whose native language is Arabic.

A collection of poems and parables, some translated by him for his own works in Arabic and others written directly in English with an admirable fluency and command of the Western tongue.

His poetry is a blend of ancient imagery coupled with the poignant irony of modern introspection.
