“Do you owe your allegiance to Communist China?”

“I do not,” Tsien replied.

“To whom do you owe allegiance?”

“I owe allegiance to the people of China.”

Del Guercio sparred with Tsien for a moment and then demanded: “In the event of a conflict between this country and Red China, would you fight against Red China for the United States?”

Tsien parried: “The situation had not presented itself. There was no such war.”

Again, Tsien’s lawyer protested: “His client would need time to think about such a question.”

“We will wait here six months,” Del Guercio snapped.

But Tsien volunteered that it would take only moments.

The room fell silent. Five minutes ticked by.

Finally, Tsien said, “I can’t answer the question now.”

“You can’t or won’t answer the question now?”

“I can — c-a-n — answer the question now,” replied Tsien, stung, “and the answer is as follows: I have already said that my essential allegiance is to the people of China, and if the war between the United States and Communist China is for the good of the people of China, which I think is very likely to be, so then I will fight on the side of the United States. No question about that.”

“But you will make the decision first? You will determine whether it is for the good of the Chinese people?” Del Guercio asked.

“That decision, yes, I would make.”

“You will not permit the Government of the United States to make that decision for you?”

“No, certainly not.”
